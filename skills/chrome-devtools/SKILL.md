description: Uses Chrome DevTools via MCP for efficient debugging, troubleshooting and browser automation. Use when debugging web pages, automating browser interactions, analyzing performance, or inspecting network requests. This skill does not apply to `--slim` mode (MCP configuration).

## Core Concepts

**Browser lifecycle**: Browser starts automatically on first tool call using a persistent Chrome profile. Configure via CLI args in the MCP server configuration: `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --help`.

**Page selection**: Tools operate on the currently selected page. Use `list_pages` to see available pages, then `select_page` to switch context.

**Element interaction**: Use `take_snapshot` to get page structure with element `uid`s. Each element has a unique `uid` for interaction. If an element isn't found, take a fresh snapshot - the element may have been removed or the page changed.

**Snapshot uid scope**: `uid`s from `take_snapshot` are MCP references, not DOM attributes. Do not use them in `querySelector()` or other selector strings. When a script needs one of those elements, pass the `uid` through `evaluate_script` args so the tool resolves it to a real element handle.

**Script scope**: `evaluate_script` runs in the currently selected page or frame only. Do not try to navigate by setting `window.location` inside the evaluated function. Use `navigate_page` or `new_page`, wait for the destination page, then run another `evaluate_script`.

## Workflow Patterns

### Before interacting with a page

1. Navigate: `navigate_page` or `new_page`
2. Wait: `wait_for` to ensure content is loaded if you know what you look for.
3. Snapshot: `take_snapshot` to understand page structure
4. Interact: Use element `uid`s from snapshot for `click`, `fill`, etc.

### Efficient data retrieval

- Use `filePath` parameter for large outputs (screenshots, snapshots, traces)
- Use pagination (`pageIdx`, `pageSize`) and filtering (`types`) to minimize data
- Set `includeSnapshot: false` on input actions unless you need updated page state

### Tool selection

- **Automation/interaction**: `take_snapshot` (text-based, faster, better for automation)
- **Visual inspection**: `take_screenshot` (when user needs to see visual state)
- **Additional details**: `evaluate_script` for data not in accessibility tree. Use valid native DOM APIs/selectors only; avoid library-specific pseudo-classes like `:contains(...)`.

### Parallel execution

You can send multiple tool calls in parallel, but maintain correct order: navigate → wait → snapshot → interact.

## Troubleshooting

If `chrome-devtools-mcp` is insufficient, guide users to use Chrome DevTools UI:
