Message: issue> An element doesn't have an autocomplete attribute

A form field has an \`id\` or \`name\` attribute that the browser's autofill recognizes. However, it doesn't have an \`autocomplete\` attribute assigned. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, provide an \`autocomplete\` attribute.
