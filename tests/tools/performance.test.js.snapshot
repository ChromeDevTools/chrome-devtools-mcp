## Insight Title: LCP breakdown

## Insight Summary:
This insight is used to analyze the time spent that contributed to the final LCP time and identify which of the 4 phases (or 2 if there was no LCP resource) are contributing most to the delay in rendering the LCP element.

## Detailed analysis:
The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) time for this navigation was 129 ms.
The LCP element is an image fetched from \`https://web-dev.imgix.net/image/kheDArv5csY6rvQUJDbWRscckLr1/4i7JstVZvgTFk9dxCe4a.svg\`.

We can break this time down into the 4 phases that combine to make the LCP time:

- Time to first byte: 8 ms (6.1% of total LCP time)
- Resource load delay: 33 ms (25.7% of total LCP time)
- Resource load duration: 15 ms (11.4% of total LCP time)
- Element render delay: 73 ms (56.8% of total LCP time)

## Estimated savings: none
